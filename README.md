FORSAKEN
I have social anxiety/social awkwardness.DON'T JUDGE ME! I'm a victim of verbal bullying. 

I am from Indonesia, I respond slowly sometimes my phone experiences Android failure. 

I'm not always friendly to other players, just to remind you I'm a bit toxic! And don't expect too much from me.

 -I'm a bit sensitive, so please respect my boundaries because I've seen a lot of annoying people lately. Oh, and I can't talk about anything other than my fandom, LOL. 

-Age below the limit, name? Uh, call me famous or fizou.

I play Forsaken as:
-/Chance M4
-/Elliot M4 
-/Taph M4
-/Noob M4
-/Two time M3 = (I honestly hate two time, if you don't like it, I'm sorry)
-/Builderman = (honestly not at all, only sometimes)
-/Veeronica = (hmm... it's pretty annoying, but I don't know if it's useful or not :/) 
-/Guest1337 M1 = (I'm not good at playing as a guest, I also get overwhelmed. By the way, my little sister taught me how to play guest) -/007n7 = (hmm no) 
-/Shedletsky = (I've never played this either)

-you can c+h/or w2i (whisper privately with me) 

-i often afk/offtab and don't think i don't see the dirty player behavior on your ass

-DNI/DNIUF for something like ships or anything, and toxic personal like oc. 

some of the following ships: 
-doublefedora 
-paycheck
